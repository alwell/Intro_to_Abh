# The Five Khandhas
All that is real can be classified as four ultimate realities,
paramattha dhammas: as citta, cetasika, rūpa and nibbāna. Citta,
cetasika and rūpa are conditioned realities that arise and fall away and
nibbāna is the unconditioned element that does not arise and fall away.
All conditioned realities that arise and fall away can be classified as
five khandhas, aggregates. The five khandhas are not different from the
three paramattha dhammas which are citta, cetasika and rūpa. The five
khandhas are:

-   Rūpakkhandha, all physical phenomena
-   Vedanā kkhandha, feeling (vedanā)
-   Saññākkhandha, remembrance or “perception” (saññā)
-   Saṅkhārakkhandha, comprising fifty cetasikas (mental factors arising
    with the citta)
-   Viññāṇakkhandha, comprising all cittas

As regards the fifty-two kinds of cetasika which may arise with citta,
they are classified as three khandhas: the cetasika which is feeling
(vedanā) is classified as one khandha; the cetasika which is remembrance
or “perception” (saññā) is classified as one khandha; as regards the
other fifty cetasikas, they are classified altogether as one khandha,
the khandha of formations, saṅkhārā kkhandha. For example, in
saṅkhārakkhandha are included cetasikas such as volition or intention
(cetanā), attachment (lobha), aversion (dosa), ignorance (moha), loving
kindness (mettā), generosity (alobha) and wisdom (paññā ). All
defilements and all good qualities are included in saṅkhārā kkhandha,
they are impermanent not “self”. Saṅkhārākkhandha is sometimes
translated as “ activities” or “mental formations”. As regards citta,
all cittas are one khandha: viññāṇakkhandha. Thus, one khandha is
rūpakkhandha and the other four khandhas are nāmakkhandhas. Three
nāmakkhandhas are cetasika and one nā makkhandha is citta. Anything
which is khandha does not last; as soon as it has arisen it falls away
again. Although khandhas arise and fall away, they are real; we can
experience them when they present themselves. The khandhas arise and
fall away all the time. When seeing arises, there is viññāṇakkhandha,
and there are the accompanying cetasikas: vedanā kkhandha, saññākhandha,
saṅkhā rakkhandha (including cetasikas apart from feeling and saññā),
and there is eyesense which is rūpa-kkhandha. Thus, the khandhas are:
citta, cetasika and rū pa arising at this moment. We do not have to name
them in order to know them, they each have their own characteristic that
can be realised without naming. Thinking arises shortly after seeing has
fallen away, but we may be confused about different cittas and take
seeing and thinking together. Thus, it seems that we see immediately a
person or a tree, but these are concepts we think about, they are not
seen through the eyesense. Seeing sees only what is visible and it is
different from thinking. At the moment of thinking there are five
khandhas, but these are different from the khandhas that arose at the
moment of seeing. We may think of a person or tree with clinging and
wrong view. The citta that thinks is viññāṇakkhandha, and there are the
accompanying cetasikas: vedanā kkhandha, saññākhandha and
saṅkhārakkhandha in which are now included clinging and wrong view.
Moreover there is a rūpa that is the physical base of thinking. Cittas
arise and fall away so rapidly that it is difficult to distinguish
different cittas from each other. It seems that there is one citta
performing different functions at the same time. We take seeing and
thinking for my seeing and thinking. We read in the “Kindred Sayings”
(III, 140, translated by Ven. Bodhi) that the Buddha, while he was
dwelling at Ayojjhā, said to the monks:

> “Bhikkhus, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great
> lump of foam. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder it, and
> carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void,
> hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of
> foam? So too, bhikkhus, whatever kind of form there is, whether
> past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle,
> inferior or superior, far or near: a bhikkhu inspects it, ponders it,
> and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void,
> hollow, insubstantial. For what substance could there be in form?”

The Buddha then goes on to make the same observation by way of similes
on the four nāmakkhandhas of feeling, perception, volitional formations
and conscious-ness. When we take the khandhas as a “whole” of a person,
we have wrong view of self. Thus, when we fail to see the different
characteristics of naama and ruupa when they appear one at a time, we
take them for a self or a person.
