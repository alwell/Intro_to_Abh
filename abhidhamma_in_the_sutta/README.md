# Abhidhamma in the Sutta

In the Anguttara Nikāya, Book of the Ones (Ch VIII, § 4) we read about
right understanding as being the most precious in life - that which
doesn’t bring sorrow:

> “Of slight account, monks, is the loss of such things as relatives.
> Miserable indeed among losses is the loss of wisdom. Of slight
> account, monks, is the increase of such things as relatives. Chief of
> all the increases is that of wisdom... Of slight account, monks, is
> the loss of such things as wealth. Miserable indeed among losses is
> the loss of wisdom. Of slight account, monks, is the increase of such
> things as wealth. Chief of all the increases is that of wisdom... “Of
> slight account, monks, is the loss of such things as reputation.
> Miserable indeed among losses is the loss of wisdom. Of slight
> account, monks, is the increase of such things as reputation. Chief of
> all the increases is that of wisdom. Wherefore I say, monks, you
> should train yourselves thus: We will increase in wisdom. You must
> train yourselves to win that.”

This sutta is an exhortation to develop right understanding of
realities. Understanding of realities is the most precious in life, as
the above-quoted sutta states. Sutta reading is not easy and we have to
carefully consider each word of the sutta. We have to know what kind of
understanding is meant in this sutta. The Buddha pointed to the
development of understanding of all realities in daily life, no matter
he taught Sutta or Abhidhamma. The Abhidhamma helps us to understand the
deep meaning of the suttas. We may be inclined to overlook the
implications of the meaning of understanding, when we read that
understanding is the most precious of all. We have to know what kind of
understanding, understanding of which objects. Also in the suttas the
Buddha teaches to develop right understanding of ultimate realities, but
in the suttas the Buddha mostly speaks about people’s situations in
daily life, about their clinging to pleasant objects, and the sorrow
caused by clinging. He spoke in conventional terms in order to help
people to understand what is true in the ultimate sense. Whatever
reality arises does so because of the proper conditions. The conditioned
realities of our life are citta, consciousness, cetasika, mental factors
arising with the citta and rūpa, physical phenomena. These are three
conditioned paramattha dhammas. There is no person, no self who sees,
clings, feels sadness; there are only nāma, mental phenomena, and
physical phenomena, rūpa. In the above-quoted sutta we are reminded that
right understanding is more precious than people we hold dear or
possessions. It is the understanding that whatever occurs in life, be it
pleasant or unpleasant, are only conditioned dhammas. When we suffer the
loss of dear people we should remember that also sadness is a
conditioned dhamma, a cetasika, mental factor, arising with akusala
citta. It only lasts for one moment, it falls away and then there is a
next moment of consciousness. At the moment of seeing there is no
sadness at the same time; seeing experiences a different object: visible
object. Each citta only experiences one object at a time. Through the
Abhidhamma we are reminded all the time that there is no person who
clings, no person who suffers, that only citta and the accompanying
cetasikas experience different objects, be these unpleasant or pleasant.
There is no person who develops understanding; understanding, paññā, is
a cetasika that can only arise when there are the appropriate conditions
for it. The Abhidhamma is not a theory one finds in a textbook; the
teaching of the Abhidhamma is about all the realities that appear at
this moment. The Abhidhamma teaches about seeing, about thinking of what
was seen, about all the defilements arising on account of what is
experienced through the senses and the mind-door.
