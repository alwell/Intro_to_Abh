# Conclusion

All the texts of the Tipiṭaka , including the Abhidhamma, are not meant
merely for intellectual study or memorizing, they are directed to the
practice, the development of vipassanā. All the classifications of
cittas, cetasikas and rūpas are terse reminders of the truth, they are
an exhortation to develop understanding of what appears at this moment.
This is the development of the eightfold Path leading to the eradication
of all defilements.
