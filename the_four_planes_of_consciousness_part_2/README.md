# The Four Planes of Consciousness (part 2)

As we have seen, there are four planes of citta: the sensuous plane of
consciousness, the plane of rūpa-jhāna, the plane of arūpa-jhā na, and
the plane of lokuttara citta, supramundane citta. When enlightenment is
attained lokuttara cittas arise which directly experience nibbāna. The
lokuttara citta is the highest plane of consciousness. There are four
stages of enlightenment: the stages of the sotāpanna (streamwinner), the
sakadāg āmī (once-returner), the anāgāmī (no-returner) and the arahat.
At each of these stages the lokuttara kusala citta, the
path-consciousness (magga-citta), arises which experiences nibbāna and
eradicates defilements. The magga-citta of each of these stages is
succeeded immediately by the lokuttara vipākacitta, the
fruition-consciousness (phala-citta) which also experiences nibbāna.\
Wrong view has to be eradicated first. So long as one takes realities
for self there cannot be the eradication of any defilement. The
sotāpanna, the ariyan who has attained the first stage of enlightenment,
has eradicated diṭṭhi completely, so that it can never arise again, but
he has not eradicated all defilements. Defilements are eradicated stage
by stage and only when arahatship has been attained all defilements have
been eradicated. Only the right Path, the eightfold Path, can lead to
enlightenment. The eightfold Path is developed by being mindful of the n
āma and rūpa which appear in daily life, such as seeing, visible object,
hearing, sound, thinking, feeling, attachment, anger or the other
defilements which arise. This is actually the development of vipassanā,
insight-wisdom. There are several stages of insight-wisdom. The
characteristics of nāma and rūpa have to be investigated over and over
again until they are clearly understood as they are and there is no more
wrong view about them. The realization of the arising and falling away
of nāma and rūpa, their impermanence, is a higher stage of insight which
cannot be attained so long as the characteristic of n āma cannot be
distinguished from the characteristic of rūpa. All the different stages
of insight have to be attained in the right order. Paññā should continue
to investigate the characteristics of realities as they appear through
the six doors so that the three characteristics of conditioned
realities, namely: impermanence (anicca), dukkha and non-self (anattā),
can be penetrated more and more. When paññā has clearly understood these
three characteristics enlightenment can be attained. Paññā which has
become lokuttara paññā experiences nibbāna, the unconditioned reality.
Nibbāna does not arise and fall away; it is the end of the arising and
falling away of nāma and rūpa, the end of birth, old age, sickness and
death. Nibbāna is the end of dukkha. When one has attained the first
stage of enlightenment, the stage of the sotāpanna, it is certain that
there will eventually be an end to the cycle of birth and death, an end
to dukkha. When the person who is not an arahat dies, the last citta of
his life, the cuti-citta (dying-consciousness) is succeeded by the
paṭisandhi-citta (rebirth-consciousness) of the next life and thus life
goes on. So long as there are defilements life has to continue. The fact
that we are here in the human plane is conditioned by defilements. Even
if there is birth in a heavenly plane, in a rūpa-brahma plane or in an
ar ūpa-brahma plane, it is conditioned by defilements. The arahat has no
more defilements, he does not have to be reborn in any plane. For him
there will not be the arising of nāma and rūpa in a new life any more,
and this means the end to the cycle of birth and death. We read in the
Kindred Sayings (IV, Kindred Sayings on Sense, Third Fifty, Chapter 5,
§152, Is there a Method?), that the Buddha spoke to the monks about the
method to realize through direct experience the end to dukkha:

> “Herein, monks, a monk, seeing visible object with the eye, either
> recognizes within him the existence of lust, malice and illusion,
> thus: ‘I have lust, malice and illusion,’ or recognizes the
> non-existence of these qualities within him, thus: ‘I have not lust,
> malice and illusion.’ Now as to that recognition of their existence or
> non-existence within him, are these conditions, I ask, to be
> understood by belief, or inclination, or hearsay, or argument as to
> method, or reflection on reasons, or delight in speculation?’ ‘ Surely
> not, lord.’ ‘Are not these states to be understood by seeing them with
> the eye of wisdom?’ ‘Surely, lord.’ ‘Then, monks, this is the method
> by following which, apart from belief… a monk could affirm insight
> thus: Ended is birth, lived is the righteous life, done is the task,
> for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.’ ”

We then read that the same is said with regard to the experiences
through the doorways of the ears, nose, tongue, bodysense and mind. The
development of understanding of all that is real, also of one’s
defilements, is the way leading to the eradication of defilements, to
the end of rebirth. This is the end to dukkha.
