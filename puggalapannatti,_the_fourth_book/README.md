# Puggalapaññatti, the fourth Book

The fourth book of the Abhidhamma is the Puggalapaññatti (Translated as
“A Designation of Human Types”). This book deals with the cittas and the
different accumulated tendencies of individuals. Some people are easily
inclined to anger, whereas others are full of mettā. We read about an
angry person: ‘What sort of person is angry? What then is anger? That
which is anger, and the state of being angry, hatred, hating,
hatefulness, malice, the act of being malicious, maliciousness,
hostility, enmity, rudeness, abruptness, resentment of heart- this is
called anger. He who has not got rid of this anger is said to be an
angry person.” In this definition we read about the “ state of being
angry”, and this teaches us that anger is not a person, that it is a
dhamma which is conditioned. We think of an angry person, but anger,
after it has arisen, is gone completely, it does not last. The contents
of this book are the evil and good qualities of individuals, but
actually, these are cetasikas, mental factors arising because of
conditions. Thus, we are constantly reminded that these are not persons,
they are impermanent and not self. We read (II, 17) about a person who
is guarded as to the sense-doors. There is no person who is guarding the
sense-doors, but the realities of sati and paññā are guarding the
sense-doors. When there is mindfulness and understanding of visible
object appearing through the eye-door, of sound appearing through the
ear-door, of the other sense objects appearing through the other
sense-doors, one is not enslaved by these objects but one learns to see
these realities as they are: impermanent and non-self. At such moments
there is no opportunity for akusala cittas rooted in lobha, dosa and
moha. Some persons are able to attain jhāna, others do not. We read (I,
30):

> “Which is the person who is twice-liberated (ubhatobhā ga-vimutta)? It
> is one who, in his own person, has attained to the eight liberations
> (jhānas), and through wise penetration his taints (ā sava) have come
> to extinction.” (I, 31) “Which is the person who is liberated by
> wisdom (paññā-vimutta)? It is one who has not attained, in his own
> person, to the eight liberations, but through wise penetration his
> taints have come to extinction.”\
> When we read about the attainments of different individuals we should
> not forget that these are citta and cetasikas with highly developed
> paññā.
