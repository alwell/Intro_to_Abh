#  Rebirth in different Planes of Existence (2)

Rebirth-consciousness does not only arise in sensuous planes of
existence, kāma-bhūmi, it can also arise in higher heavenly planes which
are not sensuous planes of existence. If one is born in one of the
kāma-bhūmis and one sees the disadvantage of sense impressions, one may
cultivate jhāna, absorption. Then one can, besides kāmāvacara cittas,
also have rūpa-jh ānacittas and arūpa-jhānacittas. If one cultivates the
eightfold Path one can have lokuttara cittas, supramundane cittas which
directly experience nibbā na. There are four planes of citta: kāmāvacara
cittas, rūpāvacāra cittas which are rūpajhānacittas, arūpāvacāra cittas
which are arūpajhānacittas and lokuttara cittas. Which of these planes
of citta a particular citta belongs to, depends on the object it
experiences. Kāmāvacara citta experiences a sense object. Rūpāvacā ra
cittas and arūpāvacāra cittas experience with absorption the meditation
subjects of rūpa-jhāna and arūpa-jhāna. Lokuttara citta experiences
nibbāna. A plane of citta is different from a plane of existence which,
as we have seen, is the place where rebirth-consciousness arises.\
When someone attains jhāna, the kusala kamma he performs is not
kāmāvacara kusala kamma; at the moment of jhā na there are no sense
impressions. The kusala kamma which is jhāna does not produce result in
the same lifespan one attains it, but it can produce result in the form
of paṭisandhi-citta, the paṭ isandhi-citta of the next life. In that
case there are jhānacittas arising shortly before death and the
paṭisandhi-citta of the next life experiences the same object as those
jhānacittas. The result of rū pā vacara kusala citta (kusala citta which
is rūpa-jhānacitta) is birth in a heavenly plane which is not kāma-bhūmi
(sensuous plane of existence) but a rū pa-brahma-plane (fine-material
world). The result of an arūpāvacara kusala citta (kusala citta which is
arūpa-jhā nacitta) is birth in a heavenly plane which is an arūpa-brahma
plane (immaterial world). There are different rūpa-brahma planes and arū
pa-brahma planes. Those who attain rūpa-jhāna can be reborn in rū
pa-brahma-planes where there are less sense-impressions. There are
sixteen rū pa-brahma planes in all. One of these is the plane of
unconscious beings, asaññasatta. Those who cultivate rūpa-jhāna and see
the disadvantage of nāma may be reborn in a plane where there is only
rūpa, not nāma. Thus, here there is not a rebirth-consciousness, only
rūpa-paṭisandhi. Those who see the disadvantages of the meditation
subjects of rūpa-jhāna which are still bound up with materiality,
cultivate arūpa-jhāna. If they attain arūpa-jhāna they can be reborn in
arūpa-brahma planes where there is no rūpa, only nā ma. There are four
classes of arūpa-brahma planes. There are thirty-one classes of planes
of existence in all, namely:

11 sensuous planes:

-   4 woeful planes
-   1 human plane
-   6 deva planes
-   16 rūpa-brahma planes
-   4 arūpa-brahma planes

Kusala kamma can cause a happy rebirth, but the end of birth is to be
preferred to any kind of rebirth. If one cultivates the eightfold Path
and attains arahatship there will be no more rebirth. The
dying-consciousness (cuti-citta) of the arahat is not succeeded by a
paṭisandhi-citta. The Buddha reminded people of the dangers of birth and
encouraged them to be mindful, in order to attain the “deathless’” which
is nibbāna. We read in the Mahā-parinibbāna-sutta (Dialogues of the
Buddha I, no. 16, chapter I, 1-4):

> “... The Exalted One proceeded with a great company of the: monks
> to Kotigāma; and there he stayed in the village itself. And at that
> place the Exalted One addressed the monks, and said: ‘It is through
> not understanding and grasping four Ariyan Truths, O monks, that we
> have had to run so long, to wander so long in this weary path of
> rebirth, both you and I!’ And what are these four? The Ariyan truth
> about dukkha; the Ariyan truth about the cause of dukkha; the Ariyan
> truth about the cessation of dukkha; and the Ariyan truth about the
> path that leads to that cessation. But when these Ariyan truths are
> grasped and known the craving for future life is rooted out, that
> which leads to renewed becoming is destroyed, and then there is no
> more birth!’ ”
