# The Seven Books of the Abhidhamma

## Introduction

The Abhidhamma consists of the following seven books:

1.  Dhammasangaṇī (translated as “Buddhist Psychological Ethics”, P.T.S.
    and also translated by U Kyaw, Myanmar.)
2.  Vibhaṅga (translated as “ Book of Analysis”, P.T.S.)
3.  Dhātukathā (Translated as “Discourse on Elements”, P.T.S.)
4.  Puggalapaññatti (Translated as “A Designation of Human Types”,
    P.T.S.)
5.  Kathā vatthu (Translated as “Points of Controversy”, P.T.S.)
6.  Yamaka (the Book of Pairs, not translated into English)
7.  Paṭṭhāna (Translated in part as “Conditional Relations”, P.T.S. )

A summary of the contents of these seven books has been given by Ven.
Nyanatiloka in his “Guide through the Abhidhamma Piṭaka” (B.P.S. Kandy,
1971) and also by U Kyaw Khine in the introduction to his translation of
the Dhammasaṅ ganī. Therefore, I will render only some salient features
of each book with the purpose to show that the classifications found in
the Abhidhamma are not mere lists to be read and memorized. They all
point to the investigation of the realities of our daily life. In this
way the paññā is developed that sees realities as they are, as
impermanent, dukkha and anattā. This kind of paññā leads to the
eradication of defilements. The commentary to the Dhammasaṅganī, the
first book, is the “Atthasālinī”, edited by the venerable Buddhaghosa
and translated as “Expositor”. The Dhammasaṅganī begins with the Mātika,
a table of contents or matrix, which is an introduction. It is more
extensive than a table of contents. This mā tikā has been arranged by
way of triads and dyads. It is a survey of the contents of the first
book and can even serve as an introduction to all seven books. Different
groups of defilements have been listed, such as the intoxicants
(āsavas), fetters, ties, floods, yokes, hindrances. After the Abhidhamma
matrix there is a Suttanta matrix, explaining sutta terms. The Atthas
ālinī, the commentary to the Dhammasaṅganī, dedicates a whole chapter to
explain the notions of the Mātika. The Mātikā begins with: kusala
dhammā, akusala dhammā, avyā kata dhammā. In these three terms all that
is real has been contained. In avyākata dhammā, indeterminate dhammas,
are included all realities that are not kusala or akusala, namely:
vipākacittas, kiriyacittas, rū pas and nibbāna. The whole Tipiṭaka is
directed towards the liberation from the cycle of birth and death
through insight. This appears also in the Mātika, where we read
(1013-1015):

> "Dhammas going to building up; going to pulling down; going to
> neither." The Atthasālinī elaborates: "... ’accumulation’ means that
> which is accumulated by kamma and corruptions. It is a name for the
> processes of rebirth and decease. ’Leading to accumulation’ are ’those
> causes which by being accomplished to go to, lead a man, in whom they
> arise, to that round of rebirth’. It is a name for co-intoxicant moral
> or immoral states. Nibbāna being free from ’cumulation’, which is
> another word for ’accumulation’, is called dispersion. ’Leading to
> dispersion’ is ’going towards that dispersion which he has made his
> object.’ It is a name for the Ariyan Paths. Or, ’leading to
> accumulation’ are those states which go about severally arranging
> (births and deaths in) a round of destiny like a bricklayer who
> arranges bricks, layer by layer, in a wall.’ ’Leading to dispersion’
> are those states which go about destroying that very round, like a man
> who continually removes the bricks as they are laid by the mason."
