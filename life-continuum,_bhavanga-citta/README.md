# Life-continuum, bhavanga-citta

There are moments when there are no sense-impressions, when one does not
think, when there are no akusala cittas or kusala cittas. Even when
there are no sense-impressions and no thinking there must be citta;
otherwise there would be no life. The type of citta which arises and
falls away at those moments is called bhavanga-citta. Bhavanga literally
means “factor of life”; bhavanga is usually translated into English as
“life-continuum”. The bhavanga-citta keeps the continuity in a lifespan,
so that what we call a “being” goes on to live from moment to moment.
That is the function of the bhavanga-citta. There are countless
bhavanga-cittas arising at those moments when there are no
sense-impressions, no thinking, no akusala cittas or kusala cittas. When
we are asleep and dreaming akusala cittas and kusala cittas arise, but
even when we are in a dreamless sleep there still has to be citta. There
are bhavanga-cittas at such moments. Also when we are awake countless
bhavanga-cittas arise; they arise in between the different processes of
citta. It seems that hearing, for example, can arise very shortly after
seeing, but in reality there are different processes of citta and in
between these processes bhavanga-cittas arise. When an object contacts
one of the five senses the stream of bhavanga-cittas is interrupted and
a sense-cognition arises. However, there cannot be a sense-cognition
immediately. When sound, for example, impinges on the earsense, there is
not immediately hearing. There are still some bhavanga-cittas arising
and falling away before the five-sense-door adverting-consciousness
(pañca-dvārā vajjana-citta) adverts to the sound through the ear-door
and hearing arises. The bhavanga-cittas do not perform the function of
adverting to the sound which contacts the earsense, they do not
experience the sound. They have their own function which is keeping the
continuity in a lifespan. In the “Atthas ālinī”, the commentary to the
first book of the Abhidhamma, the Dhammasangaṅi, the parable of the
Mango is given, explaining a process of cittas after the stream of
bhavanga has been arrested. We read (Expositor, 271, part X, no 2,
Discourse on the moral result of the sensuous realm) that a man went to
sleep under a mango-tree. A ripe mango fell down, grazing his ear.
Awakened by the sound he looked, stretched out his hand, took the fruit,
squeezed it, smelt it and ate it. We read:

> “What does this simile signify? The function of the object striking
> the sentient organism. When this happens there is the function of
> adverting by the five doors just agitating the life-continuum, the
> function of just seeing by visual cognition, of just receiving the
> object by the resultant mind-element (receiving-consciousness], of
> just the examining of the object by the resultant element of
> mind-cognition (investigating-consciousness), the determining of the
> object by the inoperative element of mind-cognition (the kiriyacitta
> which is determining-consciousness). But verily only the apperception
> (the series of javana-cittas) enjoys the taste of the object.”

Processes of cittas occur at this moment: seeing, attachment to what is
seen, thinking about it and taking it for a person or thing. It seems
that when there is seeing we think at the same time of a person or
thing, but each citta cognizes only one object at a time. It is
beneficial to learn about the different processes of cittas that succeed
one another extremely rapidly. When one has not studied the Dhamma one
confuses the different doorways and the different objects, one “joins”
them together. One is inclined to believe that there is a self who
coordinates all the different expriences. In reality there are only
different cittas arising because of their appropriate conditions that
experience different objects one at a time. When we look at people they
seem to last, and this is because we think for a long time of shape and
form of people and of things. There are many different moments of
thinking and these fall away. Thinking is a paramattha dhamma, but the
concepts that are the objects of thinking are not paramattha dhammas. We
can learn to discern when we are in the world of concepts and when in
the world of paramattha dhammas.
